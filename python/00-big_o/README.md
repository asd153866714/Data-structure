# Big O notation

>Here's my favorite Big O analogy:

>Let's say you're making dinner for your family. O is the process of following a recipe, and n is the number of times you follow a recipe.


>O - you make one dish that everyone eats whether they like it or not. You follow one recipe from top to bottom, then serve (1 recipe). <-- How I grew up

>O(n) - you make individual dishes for each person. You follow a recipe from top to bottom for each person in your family (recipe times the number of people in your family).

>O(n^2) - you make individual dishes redundantly for every person. You follow all recipes for each person in your family (recipe times the number of people squared).

>O(n^2) - I think if every person in your family makes individual dish for every person (so every person will have n dishes) - this could be O(n^2)

>O(log n) - you break people into groups according to what they want and make larger portions. You make one dish for each group (recipe times request)
